                            You agree that no joint venture, partnership, employment, or agency relationship exists
                            between you and Kin-Yee as a result of the Terms or your use of the App. The Terms
                            constitute the entire agreement between you and Kin-Yee with respect to your use of the App.
                            The failure of us to exercise or enforce any right or provision of the Terms shall not
                            constitute a waiver of such right or provision. If any provision of the Terms is found by a
                            court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the parties nevertheless agree that the court
                            should endeavor to give effect to the parties' intentions as reflected in the provision, and
                            the other provisions of the Terms remain in full force and effect. You may not assign,
                            delegate or otherwise transfer your account or your obligations under these Terms without
                            the prior written consent of us. We have the right, in its sole discretion, to transfer or
                            assign all or any part of its rights under these Terms and will have the right to delegate
                            or use third party contractors to fulfill its duties and obligations under these Terms and
                            in connection with the App. Our notice to you via email, regular mail, or notices or links
                            on the App shall constitute acceptable notice to you under the Terms. A printed version of
                            the Terms and of any notice given in electronic form shall be admissible in judicial or
                            administrative proceedings based upon or relating to the Terms to the same extent and
                            subject to the same conditions as other business documents and records originally generated
                            and maintained in printed form. Section titles and headings in the Terms are for convenience
                            only and have no legal or contractual effect. Any rights not expressly granted herein are
                            reserved.

                            not limit any consumer protection rights that you may be entitled to under the mandatory
                            laws of your country of residence.
