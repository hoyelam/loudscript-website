                            LoudScript collects aggregate, anonymous statistics, such as the percentage of users who use
                            specific features, to improve our application. We automatically collect certain non-personal
                            information when you visit, use, or navigate the LoudScript website and app. This
                            information includes device and usage details like your device characteristics, operating
                            system, language preferences, referring URLs, device name, country, coarse location, and
                            other technical information. We primarily use this information for maintaining the security,
                            performance, stability and operation of our applications and for internal analytics and
                            reporting.

                            LoudScript uses services provided by Mixpanel, a business analytics service company.
                            Mixpanel provides us with the means to track user interactions within our apps. The tracked
                            data is anonymous and used to identify usage trends, not individual usage. The data
                            collected includes information about how and when you use our apps, which helps us make
                            improvements to our services. For more information about Mixpanel's privacy practices, you
                            can read <a href="https://mixpanel.com/legal/privacy-policy/" class="link">Mixpanel's

                            When you use LoudScript's AI features such as text summarization and translation, your text content will be sent to third-party Large Language Models (LLMs) for processing.
